## Silence Remover

is a plugin for the DeadDBeeF music player. This plugin skips quiet passages at the beginning
and end of a track. But it can also skip (almost) noiseless areas within a track which is
often the case with an attached hidden track.
Copy the compiled plugin to the plugin folder (`~/.local/lib/deadbeef/`) and restart
DeadDBeeF, then it works without further configuration.
